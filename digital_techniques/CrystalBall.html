<h4 style="color:#FAB344">How to install the action set</h4>

Open Photoshop.
<br><br>
If you haven't already done it, extract all the files from the ZIP file into a folder on your hard disk.
<br><br>
Click and drag the .atn file from that folder to your Photoshop window.
If you look in the Actions window in Photoshop, you will see the action set appear there.

<br><br>
Open the action set by clicking the little arrow to the left of the action name. You will see one action inside.
If you are currently connected to the internet, you will see a screenshot below showing the action set and action.

<h4 style="color:#FAB344">How to use the actions</h4>

<ol>
<li>
Open an image in Photoshop.
<br><br>
</li>
<li>
Select the Crystal Ball action and click the "Play" arrow at the bottom of the Actions window. The action will make a copy of your image, leaving the original unchanged.
<br><br>
Usually, you'll want to crop your image to a square. 
One easy way to do that is to hold down the Shift Key when you "draw" with the crop tool. 
Rectangular images can be fun too, though.

</li>
</ol>
<br><br>
 
<b>Notes</b>

<ol>

<li>
The action will not work on images using some modes: Indexed Color and 16-bit, for example. 
If you see an error message similar to &quot;The command Polar Coordinates is not currently available,&quot;
change your photo to RGB, Lab, Grayscale, or CMYK mode and 8-bit mode before running the actions.
</li>
</ol>
